# Churn Telecom Analysis  
## Customer Churn Analytics – Telecommunications Industry

## 🏢 Company Overview
TeleConnect is a **hypothetical telecommunications service provider** offering mobile, internet, and bundled digital services to a large customer base. Like many telecom companies, TeleConnect operates in a **highly competitive and low-switching-cost market**, where retaining existing customers is critical to profitability.

The company faces several business challenges:
- High annual customer churn rate (~26%), exceeding industry benchmarks  
- Significant revenue loss due to churned customers  
- High customer acquisition costs compared to retention costs  
- Reactive retention strategies with limited customer segmentation  
- Lack of early identification of at-risk customers  

To address these challenges, TeleConnect’s product and analytics teams aim to build a **data-driven churn analytics framework** that identifies churn drivers, predicts churn risk, and enables targeted retention strategies.

## 🧩 Milestone Breakdown

### 🔹 Milestone 1: Customer Segmentation & Churn Pattern Analysis
This milestone focuses on understanding **who churns and why** by:
- Calculating overall churn rate and revenue impact  
- Segmenting customers by demographics, tenure, services, pricing, contracts, and payment methods  
- Identifying high-risk customer segments  
- Discovering key churn patterns and behavioral trends  

📌 *Outcome:* Clear identification of churn-prone segments and initial hypotheses about churn drivers.

---

### 🔹 Milestone 2: Hypothesis Testing & Statistical Validation
This milestone validates churn assumptions using **statistical hypothesis testing**, including:
- Testing relationships between churn and customer attributes  
- Applying appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, chi-square tests, etc.)  
- Validating whether observed churn patterns are statistically significant  

📌 *Outcome:* Statistically supported evidence for key churn drivers.

---

### 🔹 Milestone 3: Predictive Churn Modeling
This milestone focuses on predicting churn risk by:
- Building churn prediction models  
- Identifying key features influencing churn probability  
- Segmenting customers by churn risk levels  

📌 *Outcome:* Ability to proactively identify customers likely to churn.
