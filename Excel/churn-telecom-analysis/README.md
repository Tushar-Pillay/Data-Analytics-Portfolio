## 🏢 Company Overview
TeleConnect is a **hypothetical telecommunications service provider** offering mobile, internet, and bundled digital services to a large customer base. The company operates in a highly competitive market where customer retention is critical for long-term profitability.

TeleConnect faces multiple business challenges:
- High customer churn rate (~26%), exceeding industry benchmarks  
- Significant revenue loss due to churned customers  
- High customer acquisition costs compared to retention costs  
- Reactive retention strategies with limited segmentation  
- Lack of early identification of at-risk customers  

To address these challenges, the analytics team aims to build a **data-driven churn analysis and retention framework**.
