# Churn Telecom Analysis – Milestone 1  
## Customer Segmentation & Churn Pattern Analysis (Excel)

## 📌 Milestone Overview
Milestone 1 represents the **foundational analysis** of the Churn Telecom Analytics project for **TeleConnect**, a hypothetical telecommunications service provider. This milestone focuses on **customer segmentation and identifying churn patterns** using historical customer data.

The primary objective is to understand **who is churning, when churn occurs, and which customer characteristics are most strongly associated with churn**, thereby laying the groundwork for statistical validation, predictive modeling, and retention strategy development in later milestones.

> ⚠️ Note:  
> The analysis is performed using a **small, academic dataset adapted for learning and demonstration purposes** and does not represent real company data.

## 📊 Files Included in This Milestone
- **`M1_Churn_Segmentation.xlsx`**  
  Contains cleaned data, engineered features, pivot-based analysis, and churn segmentation outputs.

- **`M1_Segmentation_Report.pdf`**  
  A detailed analytical report summarizing methodology, insights, visualizations, and business interpretations.

## 🎯 Objectives of Milestone 1
- Calculate overall churn rate and assess revenue impact  
- Segment customers by demographics, tenure, services, pricing, contracts, and payment methods  
- Identify high-risk churn segments  
- Analyze behavioral and lifecycle churn patterns  
- Generate initial hypotheses about churn drivers  

---

## 🏢 Business Context
TeleConnect operates in a highly competitive telecommunications market where customer switching costs are low and retention is critical. The company currently faces:
- A churn rate of approximately **26.5%**, higher than industry benchmarks  
- Significant monthly and annual revenue loss due to churn  
- High customer acquisition costs  
- Reactive retention efforts with limited segmentation  

This milestone aims to provide a **data-driven understanding of churn behavior** to support proactive retention initiatives.

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

### 1️⃣ Overall Churn Rate & Revenue Impact
- Total customers analyzed: **7,043**
- Churned customers: **1,869**
- Overall churn rate: **~26.5%**
- Churn contributes to significant monthly and annual revenue loss, highlighting the financial urgency of churn reduction.

---

### 2️⃣ Demographic Segmentation
- **Gender:** Minimal difference in churn rates between male and female customers  
- **Senior Citizens:** Significantly higher churn (~41.7%) compared to non-senior customers  
- **Family Status:**  
  - Single customers show the highest churn  
  - Customers with dependents show the lowest churn  

**Insight:** Life-stage factors influence churn more strongly than gender.

---

### 3️⃣ Service Usage Analysis
- Core connectivity services (phone, internet, multiple lines) show moderate to high churn  
- Entertainment services (streaming TV/movies) do not significantly reduce churn  
- Value-added services (Online Security, Tech Support, Online Backup, Device Protection) are associated with **lower churn rates**

**Insight:** Support and protection services increase perceived value and customer stickiness.

---

### 4️⃣ Contract & Payment Method Analysis
- **Month-to-month contracts** exhibit the highest churn (~42.7%)  
- **Two-year contracts** show minimal churn (~2.8%)  
- Manual payment methods (electronic and mailed checks) are linked to higher churn compared to automatic payments  

**Insight:** Commitment and reduced payment friction significantly improve retention.

---

### 5️⃣ Tenure Cohort Analysis
- Highest churn occurs in the **first 12 months** (~47.4%)  
- Churn steadily declines with increased tenure  
- Long-tenure customers (49+ months) show strong loyalty  

**Insight:** Early customer lifecycle is the most critical retention window.

---

### 6️⃣ Pricing & Spend Analysis
- Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn  
- Low total spend customers churn more frequently  
- Indicates a **price–value mismatch**, not price alone, as a churn driver  

---

## 🧠 Key Churn Patterns Identified
- High churn among month-to-month contract customers  
- Elevated churn in early tenure (0–12 months)  
- Higher churn among senior citizens and single customers  
- Lower churn among customers using support and security services  
- Increased churn with manual payment methods  

---

## 🧪 Initial Hypotheses Generated
Based on Milestone 1 findings, the following hypotheses are proposed for future testing:
- Customers churn when perceived value does not justify price paid  
- Lack of proactive onboarding increases early-tenure churn  
- Absence of value-added services reduces customer stickiness  
- Manual payment processes increase churn risk  
- Uniform retention strategies fail to address segment-specific churn drivers  

These hypotheses will be **statistically tested and modeled in subsequent milestones**.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Feature engineering  
- Customer segmentation  
- Pivot tables and descriptive analytics  
- Business and product analytics

## 🚀 Milestone 1 Outcome
Milestone 1 successfully delivers a **clear segmentation-driven understanding of churn behavior**, identifying high-risk customers and actionable churn patterns. The insights from this milestone form a strong analytical foundation for **hypothesis testing, predictive churn modeling, and retention strategy design** in later stages of the project.
