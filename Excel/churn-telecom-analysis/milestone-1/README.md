# 📊 Churn Telecom Analysis – Milestone 1  
## Customer Segmentation & Churn Pattern Analysis (Excel)

## 🔍 Project Overview
This repository contains **Milestone 1** of a **Product / Business Analytics Capstone Project** focused on analyzing **customer churn** for a hypothetical telecommunications service provider, **TeleConnect**.

The objective of this milestone is to **segment customers and identify key churn patterns** using historical customer data. The insights generated here establish a strong analytical foundation for **predictive churn modeling, statistical validation, and retention strategy design** in subsequent milestones.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> The analysis is based on a **small academic dataset adapted for learning and demonstration purposes** and does not represent real company data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Calculate overall churn rate and assess revenue impact  
- Segment customers by demographics, tenure, services, pricing, contracts, and payment methods  
- Identify high-risk churn segments  
- Analyze customer lifecycle and behavioral churn patterns  
- Generate data-driven hypotheses about churn drivers

## 📁 Repository Contents
- **`M1_Churn_Segmentation.xlsx`**  
  Contains cleaned data, engineered features, pivot-table analysis, and churn segmentation outputs.

- **`M1_Segmentation_Report.pdf`**  
  A detailed analytical report covering methodology, visualizations, insights, and business interpretations.

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Overall churn rate of **~26.5%**, higher than industry benchmarks  
- **Month-to-month contracts** exhibit the highest churn  
- Churn is highest during the **first 12 months of customer tenure**  
- **Senior citizens and single customers** show elevated churn risk  
- Customers using **value-added services** (Online Security, Tech Support, Backup) demonstrate lower churn  
- Manual payment methods are associated with increased churn  
- Higher monthly charges combined with low total spend indicate a **price–value mismatch**

---

## 🧪 Initial Hypotheses
- Customers churn when perceived value does not justify price paid  
- Inadequate onboarding increases early-tenure churn  
- Absence of support and security services reduces customer stickiness  
- Payment friction increases churn risk  
- Uniform retention strategies fail to address segment-specific churn drivers  

These hypotheses will be **tested and validated** in future milestones using statistical techniques and predictive models.
