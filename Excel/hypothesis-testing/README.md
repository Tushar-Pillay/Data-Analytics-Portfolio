## 📊 Problem Statements & Analysis

### 1️⃣ Checkout Time Reduction (Paired t-Test)
**Business Question:**  
Does a new checkout flow reduce the time taken to place an order?

- Same users observed before and after redesign  
- **Test Used:** Paired t-Test  
- **Mean Old Checkout Time:** 133.8 seconds  
- **Mean New Checkout Time:** 112.0 seconds  
- **p-value:** < 0.001  

✅ **Conclusion:**  
The new checkout flow significantly reduces checkout time.

### 2️⃣ Device Type vs Purchase Intention (Chi-Square Test)
**Business Question:**  
Does device type (Mobile/Desktop) influence purchase behavior?

- Categorical variables (Device Type vs Purchase Outcome)  
- **Test Used:** Chi-Square Test of Independence  
- **p-value:** 0.661  

❌ **Conclusion:**  
Purchase behavior is not statistically dependent on device type.

### 3️⃣ Watch Time Comparison (Independent Samples t-Test)
**Business Question:**  
Do premium users watch more content per day than free users?

- Two independent user groups  
- **Test Used:** Independent Samples t-Test  
- **p-value:** < 0.001  

✅ **Conclusion:**  
Premium users watch significantly more content per day than free users.

### 4️⃣ Landing Page A/B Test (Z-Test for Proportions)
**Business Question:**  
Does the new landing page improve signup conversion rate?

- **Variant A Conversion Rate:** 8.0%  
- **Variant B Conversion Rate:** 9.0%  
- **Z-statistic:** 1.6475  
- **p-value:** 0.0497  

✅ **Conclusion:**  
Variant B performs significantly better and should be rolled out.
